- 👋 Hi, I’m @knucklehead-ninja
- 👀 I’m interested in learning code to teach to my children so they can build cool stuff and together we can build a cool world.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and java
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really.
- 📫 How to reach me email me @ aaron@accratechsolutions.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I never knew how much fun learning could be.  I was never a school-type kid, but learning code has introduced me to a hunger I never knew I had.
